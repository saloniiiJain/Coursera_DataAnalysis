# Coursera_DataAnalysis
Coursera is a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies.In this report we will be scraping, cleaning, and exploring data. The process of data extraction, cleaning, exploration, and tokenization is implemented in the code.

Conclusion

From the analysis performed, several insights could be drawn. Most courses having higher views had a higher number of enrolled customers. It is quite obvious that the customer preference towards a particular course was based on the ratings. Professional certification courses were preferred over specialization courses and more customers enrolled into Language Learning courses.
In this project of experiential learning, we have learned how to get unstructured data from websites and social media and transform unstructured data into structured data that can be easily represented as graphs. On datasets that were taken from Coursera, data cleaning and analysis has been done. We have learned numerous methods for obtaining data in raw format, cleaning the raw data, and visualizing structured data as graphs and charts.
